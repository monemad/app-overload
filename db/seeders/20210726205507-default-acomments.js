    { comment: `The use of RALs is inappropriate, as those are based on cancer (i.e. long term exposure) criteria, not on acute (i.e. short term)criteria, as would be consistent with the definition of an IEC. The Site Remediation Reform Act (SRRA) defines "Immediate Environmental Concern" as meaning:  “(…) (3) confirmed contamination at the site of a nature that either dermal contact, ingestion, or inhalation of the contamination could result in an acute human health exposure; or (4) any other condition that poses an immediate threat to the environment or to the public health and safety”. Both “Acute” and “Immediate” are terms that describe the same set of conditions.  The term “Acute” is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) as “one dose or multiple doses of short duration spanning less than or equal to 24 hours”. Therefore, as defined by SRRA, an IEC has the documented potential to produce negative short-term effects.  SRRA does not provide a specific basis for developing indoor air levels for an IEC.  Never the less, the NJDEP has elected to use the non-promulgated RALs, which are based on the also non-promulgated IASLs.  However, IASLs are “cancer health based”, intended to be protective over a lifetime of exposure, not for use as acute exposure limits.
